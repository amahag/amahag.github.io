In June of 2021, my parents ran into the same problem that every family runs into: how do we keep our child(in this case, my youngest brother) entertained without playing video games or watching TV? They researched summer camps and summer classes but kept running into the same issues; too expensive, too short to be effective, too far away, or any of the other problems that are accompanied by summer activities. After a lot of time spent searching and very little to show for it, we were left frustrated at the lack of educational summer programs in our area.

That is, until I found Google's CS First program. Google's CS First program is an educational initiative aimed at introducing computer science to students at an early age. It provides free coding lessons and resources for teachers to use. There are a wide array of lessons that civer subjects such as animation, game design, and coding basics which use Scratch, a block-based programming language developed by MIT Media Lab. Although the program was geared towards teachers in a classroom setting, I saw no reason why I couldn't use it with my little brother. We explored the program and I was impressed by how engaging much of the material was for a 13 year old who had trouble sitting still for more than 60 seconds at a time.

A few weeks after my brother started, he showed a few of his friends from school one of the animations he had made in the program. They must have been interested in his mini-project as one of his parents reached out to me asking if I would be willing to spend some time with her son explaining the program and walking him through the steps to build his own animation. I had no problem with this and within a week, another parent had reached out to me. By the end of the summer, I had tutored 35 students, all between the age of 8 and 14, on how to make their own games and animations in Google's CS First program. I had a lot of fun throughout the process and I am incredibly grateful to have had such an experience. Many of the students still reach out to me today with questions about the great ideas they are trying to build in the platform. Here are some of the projects that my students have done!
