In June of 2021, my parents ran into the same problem that every family runs into: how do we keep our child(in this case, my youngest brother) entertained without playing video games or watching TV? They researched summer camps and summer classes but kept running into the same issues; too expensive, too short to be effective, too far away, or any other problem that is accompanied by summer activities. After a lot of time spent searching and very little to show for it, we were left frustrated at the lack of educational summer programs in our area.

That is, until I found Google's CS First program. Google's CS First program is an educational initiative aimed at introducing computer science to students at an early age. It provides free coding lessons and resources for teachers to use. There are a wide array of lessons that civer subjects such as animation, game design, and coding basics. Although the program was geared towards teachers in a classroom setting, I saw no reason why I couldn't use it with my little brother. We explored the program and I was impressed by how engaging much of the material was for a 13 year old who had trouble sitting still for more than 60 seconds at a time.
