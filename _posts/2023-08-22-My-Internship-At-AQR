I sat down with the team leads, and they walked me through the AWS Service Catalog. The system at hand revolved around a PostgreSQL production database, an integral part of the company's infrastructure. Given the critical nature of these systems, there were always numerous tasks awaiting completion and this highlighted the need for an efficient solution. Many of the tools, like the Jenkins pipeline and ServiceNow workflows, were familiar to me, but the intricate details of working with the suite of internal REST APIs was a fresh challenge. As the project progressed, the challenges mounted, but so did the rewards. By the end, the impact was evident: developers no longer faced the long delays they once dreaded. 

This was the beginning of my summer internship at AQR, a ten-week experience that involved moving to NYC for its duration. I thoroughly enjoyed my project, which involved automating database access for developers at the company. Beyond all the technical and professional skills I developed, what truly stood out were the quieter, more personal lessons. Getting to watch teams across different departments gave me a valuable understanding of corporate communication. I came to appreciate how different communication styles, each unique in its approach, can be equally effectiveWhile I expected to grasp new technologies, it was this nuanced understanding of workplace communication that emerged as a surprising, yet invaluable insight.
